# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 5th April 2019

**Today's Progress:** Downloaded Sentinel imagery

**Thoughts:**
- I have used the sentinelsat api to query and download data from the Copernicus Access Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home) before at work and found it worked well. The source code GitHub account shows recent commits. 
- It is important to save my login details for the Copernicus Access Hub as environmental variables so as not to give away password information. 
- I want to use Pathlib rather than os.path.join because it slicker, much simplier and comes with much more functionality, see this post: https://pbpython.com/pathlib-intro.html
- Time has been spend fixing QGIS in this session, I had dependency issues and aptitude saved the day.
